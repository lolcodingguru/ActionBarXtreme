Welcome to the ActionBarXtreme repository! This repository contains the source code for the plugin available at https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/111234/. â†—

Please note that the code in this repository may not always represent the features available in the stable releases of the plugin. 

I use this repository to commit and test new changes and features before releasing them as a stable version on SpigotMC. 

I may push changes without thorough testing or testing on different versions of Minecraft, simply to have a backup of my work while adding new features.

I welcome contributions to this code and encourage you to submit pull requests if you'd like to contribute.

Please keep in mind that I'm relatively new to the Spigot API and may not be able to answer all questions or address all issues immediately. But I'm committed to learning and improving.

I appreciate your interest in this project. 

Thank you!
